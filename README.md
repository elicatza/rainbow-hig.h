# Rainbow High
Rainbow High a header only command line flag parser library.

## Goal
Make flags in C gay. I've seen other command line arg
parsers written in c, but none apealing to the man lovers.

## Naming
Rainbow High is a song from Evita. I could not find a better name that
is also the title of a musical theather song.
